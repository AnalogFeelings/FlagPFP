# FlagPFP
A C# command line tool for adding a circular frame to images, with pride flags.

Uses the [Pastel](https://github.com/silkfire/Pastel) lib for color output, which makes it NO_COLOR compliant.

***Usage***: __flagpfp --image (profile pic) --flag (flag type) --margin (pixel margin) --insize (inner img size) --fsize (full size) --output (output)__

* --margin (pixel margin) is the margin of pixels to leave between the flag's border and the circle of the profile picture.

* --flag (flag type) for a list of flag types, look at [this](#flag-types)
  
* --fsize (full size) full image size, optional. Defaults to 800.

## Building FlagPFP
First off, you are going to need Visual Studio 2019, and .NET 5.0. Then open the .sln file and build it.

### Attention! 
Please copy the "Flags" and "Flag JSONs" folders to the output directory for the program to be able to look for the flag images and their definitons.

## Contributing
I am open to pull requests from everyone! Just fork it and start making pull requests :)

## Adding custom flags through JSON
Make sure the flag image is distinguisable when a circle is cropped in its middle! Also, preferably make the flag image 800x800 or just upscale it in something like 
Adobe Photoshop with filtering disabled (this is __crucial__ to having a sharp flag image after the upscale).

__Next, use this JSON template:__
```json
{
  "ConsoleHeader": "Transgender Flag",
  "FlagPattern": [ "#00D0FC", "#FFABBA", "#FFFFFF", "#FFABBA", "#00D0FC" ],
  "FlagFile": "transgender.png",
  "DesignCredits": null,
  "ParameterName": "transgender"
}
```
* "ConsoleHeader" is what will be printed when the program is ran.
* "FlagPattern" is an array of hexadecimal colors that get printed as a flag pattern next to ConsoleHeader.
* "FlagFile" the flag png or jpeg in the "Flags" folder.
* "DesignCredits" the credits to the designer of the flag that will get printed below ConsoleHeader on program use. For example, the polysexual flag has
"By McLennonSon - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=38241562" in this field.
* "ParameterName" is the name of the parameter --flag.

And you are ready to go! Save the json file with any name in the "Flag JSONs folder", and your custom flag will now be detected!

# PULL REQUESTS REGARDING THE "MAP" FLAG WILL BE DENIED.
Yes, thats right, we don't want your pedophile bullshit in this repository. Go see a psychologist if you are a MAP, you really need mental help.
